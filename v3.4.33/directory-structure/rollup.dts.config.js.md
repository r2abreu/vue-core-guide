# `rollup.dts.config.js`

Vue, like many modern JavaScript frameworks, is written in TypeScript or has TypeScript type definitions. These type definitions provide type safety and IntelliSense support in editors like VS Code.

The rollup.dts.config.js file is specifically used to bundle these TypeScript declaration files into a single file or a set of files. This bundling simplifies distribution and ensures that consumers of the library have access to accurate type definitions.
